# **üöÄ NVIDIA Workload Monitor (NWM): The Ultimate Performance & Health Dashboard for NVIDIA GPUs**

## **Welcome to Unprecedented System Insight\! üëã**

Are you tired of juggling between basic system monitors like Windows Task Manager and the raw, often overwhelming output of nvidia-smi commands? The **NVIDIA Workload Monitor (NWM)** is here to revolutionize how you understand and manage your NVIDIA GPU and system performance. This application provides a sophisticated, real-time graphical interface, presenting critical data in an intuitive dashboard, complete with interactive graphs and easily digestible spreadsheets (data tables).

Unlike traditional tools, NWM is designed to give you **more than just numbers**; it offers a visual narrative of your system's behavior. While Task Manager provides only superficial GPU utilization, and nvidia-smi gives you detailed but static command-line snapshots, NWM transforms this information into a dynamic, user-friendly experience. Soon, it will also automatically download comprehensive **logs in both CSV and JSON formats every minute**, offering an invaluable historical record of your system's performance. This level of automated data collection and presentation goes far beyond what built-in tools or simple command-line outputs can provide.

### **Why NWM is Your Next Essential Tool:**

For professionals in **3D rendering, AI/Machine Learning, and scientific computing**, understanding your hardware's behavior under extreme load is paramount. This is where NWM truly shines:

* **Beyond Basic Monitoring:** While it's useful for any NVIDIA GPU user, NWM's depth of information is especially critical for **multi-GPU setups** common in data centers and high-performance workstations. It provides detailed, per-GPU metrics that are essential for balancing workloads, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing complex applications.  
* **Diagnosing the "Why":** Crashes, slowdowns, or unexpected power consumption in AI training or 3D rendering are often mysteries with generic monitors. NWM provides the granular temperature, power draw, and utilization data needed to precisely understand *why* an application behaved a certain way, leading to faster debugging and more stable operations.  
* **Aimed at Professionals, Not Just Gamers:** While NWM can certainly be used to monitor your GPU during gaming sessions, its core focus is not on gaming-specific metrics like FPS (Frames Per Second). Instead, it prioritizes the deep system and GPU health data that **3D and AI professionals** desperately need. Gaming has its own suite of specialized tools; AI and demanding 3D workflows often lack comprehensive, easy-to-interpret monitoring solutions, especially for datacenter GPUs where continually running shell prompts like MSDOS is cumbersome and time-consuming.  
* **More Than nvidia-smi:** Beyond presenting nvidia-smi data graphically, NWM encompasses broader system metrics (CPU, RAM) and is designed to evolve with additional features that go beyond the scope of a single command-line utility.

## **‚ú® Features (Current Version)**

This is the **first version** of NVIDIA Workload Monitor, laying a robust foundation for future enhancements. Currently, NWM provides:

* **Dynamic GPU Insights:** Visualizes crucial metrics for each detected NVIDIA GPU:  
  * **GPU Utilization (%):** How busy your GPU's processing units are.  
  * **Memory Utilization (%):** Percentage of your GPU's dedicated memory in use.  
  * **Power Draw (W):** Real-time power consumption, scaled as a percentage of your GPU's maximum power limit (TDP).  
  * **Temperature (¬∞C):** Current GPU core temperature, with fun emoji indicators for quick visual status.  
* **System-Wide Performance:** Monitors your CPU and RAM utilization:  
  * **CPU Utilization (%):** Overall processor activity.  
  * **RAM Utilization (%):** System memory usage.  
* **Interactive Graphs:** Utilizes Plotly to provide engaging, real-time line graphs for all metrics, allowing you to easily track trends over time.  
* **Detailed Data Tables:** Presents the last 15 data entries for each GPU in clear, color-coded tables, making it easy to spot anomalies.  
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work on any system (Linux/Windows) with NVIDIA GPUs and installed drivers.

## **üöÄ Future Vision & Ideas**

NWM is just getting started\! We have a lot of exciting ideas planned to expand its capabilities and make it an even more powerful tool:

* **Automated Log Downloads:** Implementing the automatic CSV and JSON log downloads every minute for comprehensive historical analysis.  
* **Process-Level GPU Monitoring:** Identifying and displaying which specific processes are using your GPUs and how much.  
* **Advanced Alerting:** Notifying users of critical events like thermal throttling, power limit exceedances, or unusual resource spikes.  
* **Historical Data Analysis:** Features for reviewing and comparing performance logs over longer periods.  
* **Customizable Dashboards:** Allowing users to tailor the displayed metrics and layout to their specific needs.  
* **Remote Monitoring:** Exploring options for monitoring systems over a network.

## **üèÅ Getting Started**

To get the NVIDIA Workload Monitor up and running on your local machine, please follow these steps carefully.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: NVIDIA-SMI Requirement ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This application relies heavily on the nvidia-smi command-line utility. This means you must have an **NVIDIA GPU** and **NVIDIA drivers** installed on your system for the GPU monitoring features to function correctly.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Download the Entire Project Folder\! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This application requires multiple files and folders (app.py, setup.py, requirements.txt). **Please do NOT attempt to download individual files (e.g., just app.py or setup.py)** as the application will not function correctly without all its components.

### **Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended)**

The best way to get started is by cloning the Git repository. This ensures you have the complete project structure and makes future updates easier.

1. **Open your terminal or Git Bash.**  
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you want to save the project:  
   cd /path/to/your/desired/directory

3. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/filipetorresdecarvalho/NVIDIAWorkloadMonitor.git

4. **Navigate into the cloned project directory:**  
   cd NVIDIAWorkloadMonitor

### **Option 2: Download the Project as a ZIP**

If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the entire project as a ZIP archive.
